# Single User Dungeon (SUD) RPG Game

### Introduction

This is a terminal based single user dungeon (SUD) game written in Python. Escape the lair of the cultists and win back your freedom! With four different classes to choose from and a variety of dynamically varied enemies to fight, explore a 25x25 map with different areas and mob types. But that's not all... at the end of the dungeon awaits the final boss. Can you make it out alive?

### Classes

| Name  | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| GUNSLINGER      |   Gunslingers are highly accurate and do damage at a consistent rate. However, they cannot score critical hits. Gunslingers heal at a steady rate, and have moderate HP.   |
| SCRAPPER   |   Scrappers are able to score deadlier critical hits more often. However, their regular damage is quite low. Scrappers heal at a fast rate, and have low HP.  |
| FIGHTER  |    Fighters do larger amounts of damage in combat. However, they suffer from lower accuracy. Fighters heal at a slower rate, and have high HP. |
| ROGUE|  Rogues will always win initiative checks and their attacks always hit. However, they do lower amounts of damage and critical damage. Rogues heal at a steady rate, and have low HP. |
